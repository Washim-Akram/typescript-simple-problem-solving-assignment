### 7. Provide an example of using union and intersection types in TypeScript.

#### Example Of Union Types:

_Union_ types allow us to take multiple types into an single parameter or variable. It's like javascript OR(|) operator. It can be either string, number, boolean and so on.

```typescript
function formatId(id: string | number): string {
  return `ID: ${id}`;
}

console.log(formatId(123)); // Output: ID: 123
console.log(formatId("ABC123")); // Output: ID: ABC123
```

Here, id is of type string | number, meaning it can be either a string or a number. The function will accept both without any issue.

#### Example Of Intersection Types:

_Intersection_ types allow us to combine multiple types into one. It's like javascript AND(&&) operator.

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Permissions = {
  canEdit: boolean;
  canDelete: boolean;
};

type UserWithPermissions = User & Permissions;

const admin: UserWithPermissions = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  canEdit: true,
  canDelete: true,
};

console.log(admin);
```

In this example, the UserWithPermissions type combines User and Permissions properties, so the admin object has all properties from both types.
