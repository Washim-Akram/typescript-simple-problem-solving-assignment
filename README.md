# TypeScript Simple Problem Solving Project

This project contains solutions to 8 different programming problems implemented in TypeScript. Each problem is solved in its own file, from `problem-1.ts` to `problem-8.ts`.

## Project Structure

The files are organized as follows:

- `problem-1.ts` - Solution to Problem 1
- `problem-2.ts` - Solution to Problem 2
- `problem-3.ts` - Solution to Problem 3
- `problem-4.ts` - Solution to Problem 4
- `problem-5.ts` - Solution to Problem 5
- `problem-6.ts` - Solution to Problem 6
- `problem-7.ts` - Solution to Problem 7
- `problem-8.ts` - Solution to Problem 8

Each file contains a TypeScript solution for a specific problem.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the TypeScript files**:

   ```
   npx tsc

   ```

## Usage

To run a specific problem file, you can use Node.js after compiling the TypeScript code. For example, to run `problem-1.ts`:

```
node dist/problem-1.js

```

Repeat this for each file, replacing `problem-1` with the appropriate file name.
